Somebody passed by.

164
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,115
Why are they doing this to me?
I don't even watch scary movies.

165
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:18,865
- Jimin! Come with us.
- Yes?

166
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,365

Someone's there.
How can we go through?

169
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,860

[A tablet with a map to help them]
- Not this one?
- This way?

171
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,536
We found one.

172
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:33,823
[It was not a free ticket]
- Nope.
- I knew it. It's empty.

173
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:35,636
[Playing tricks]
Let's put it in there to fool others.

174
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,200
[Found the first free ticket]
Found one.

175
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,340
[Team A is confused with the starting point]
Is that the starting point?

176
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,075
- We entered that way.
- I think there's a box.

177
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,261
V, let's go!

178
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,580
[Stopped] [Stopped together]

179

Let's go.

183
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:02,650
Where should we go?

184
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:06,130
[Pushing each other to go first]
Don't hide behind me. I'm scared too.

185
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:07,870
Look! A zombie!

186
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:09,006
[The zombie did nothing]
I know you're there.

187
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:11,000
[What did I do...?] [Scared]
Please don't!

188
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,590
Hey, my heart is weak.

[Persuading the other members]
What's wrong?

191
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:23,205
There's a zombie in front.
Let's pass by it together.

192
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:24,715
[It's nothing]

193
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,390
- Why are they doing this to us?
- Seriously.

194
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,750
[So scared]
Jimin, let's go somewhere else.

195
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,570
[Pretending to be fine]
He's a foreigner.

196
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,090
[Different from what he thinks]
He's a foreigner. You can step out now.

[Worldwide handsome boy trying to
negotiate with the foreign zombies]

[Hey, foreign zombie]
Do you have a ticket?

200

No?

201
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:47,570
Don't do that.

202
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:50,020
[SUGA keeps asking why this is happening to him]
[Jin can't move a step]
Why would they do this to me?

203
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,300
[Can Team B successfully solve the mission?]
Please, don't do that.

Come on out. Or please go away.

226

[They take a different route]
I don't want to go there.

227

[Frightened out of their wits]

229

[Jimin put his fear behind
and got the hint]

247

Here it is.

for all three teams to escape]
Yeah, you know what it is, right?

254

[Hint]
The most important thing is blood type.

255
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:05,355

[Team A goes to carry out a mission
with the hint they obtained]

[Trying hard]
I don't think we can't solve this yet.

267
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,795
But this is something we need to solve.

00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:35,860
[Is RM finally overcoming his fear?]
Blood type is the most important...

269
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,022
Got it. Come here.

270
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:41,745

[Reading it the 3rd time]
Blood type is the most important.

277

[RM, come here]
Where did you find it, Taehyung?

279

[But they can't decipher the hint]
- What's this?
- Go to no.1.

After this...

307

she walked on two legs, right?

308
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:23,105
[Moving to the side]
Why?

309
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:29,285
- It's related to the surgery records.
- Surgery records.

310
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:33,265
[Team A is getting closer to the answer]
It's related to the surgery records...

[Still fighting against zombies]
Is he standing still?

312

- The daughter's surgery records.
- This is too difficult.

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,310
[Concentrating]
But I don't know.

332
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,170
Surgery records...

333
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,105
[Jung Kook found another room]

334
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:43,085
I can't solve this.
Shall we move on, guys?

335
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:46,255
[Moving on to the next hint]
- Steel bars.
- Should we bring this?

336
00:14:46,255 --> 00:14:47,445
Let's take it.

337
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,466
Where are the steel bars?

338
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:53,090
[Team C going back to
find the mission place]

339
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,785
[Like practicing high pitch songs]

340
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:57,860
This way!

341
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,650
[Wandering after finding the mission place]
- This is the right place.
- Are you sure?

342
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,520
Right. We need to go inside.

343
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,532
This is the one. That's scary.

344
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:05,808
[Boo!]

345
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,605
- Seriously.
- Are you sure?

346
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,561
[That's not the one... Jimin...]
It's locked.

347
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,320
There's a key.

348
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:16,405
[Team C finally found the quiz]
[There's a hint on the back of the ID card]

349
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:18,730
[Find out how to go into the vent
in the night duty room]

350
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,705
- Where's the night duty room?
- Night duty room.

351
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,770
Did you take anything
from the night duty room?

352
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,455
[Rummaging]
- Two items.
- Look.

353
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,860
The red one and the blank one.

354
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,270
[Found hints they don't understand]
The pattern codes...

355
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,485
Should we go inside?
There might be something.

356
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:34,471
[Ahhh!]

357
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:40,900
[Repeatedly surprised by the same zombie]

358
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,650
That scared me.

359
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,060
[Scared] [We need to get in there...]
How can we go inside? The zombie is in it.

360
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,895
There are 8 pattern code cards.

361
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,880
[Jimin and j-hope check the hint properly]
Do we have to open them all?

362
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,265
[Find 4 other cards]

363
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:57,490
[Confused] [Ridge? Road?]
"There's a road on the opposite
side of the ridge."

364
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,481
I don't get it. I guess I brought
the hint that was meant for other teams.

365
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:06,405
[Confused since they didn't read the puzzle
and just took any hints they could find]
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:07,720
There's a zombie right next to us.

367
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:11,080
[Negotiating with the zombie]
We've met so many times. You know me.

368
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:13,040
[Boo!]

369
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,658
[Team B wins against the zombie
and enters the room]

370

[Searching through]

371
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,230
Should we put on a costume?

372
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,000
Right, to be like one of the zombies.

373
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,890
[Why aren't you finding the hint?]

374
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,240
I found one! I got one!

375
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:28,549
[It's for fun...]
It's empty! Stop doing this!

376
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:30,360
[Covering up]
We tried so hard only to find an empty one.

377
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,435
[Team A arrived at
the next stage, steel bars]
Is this the right place?

378
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:35,555
DNA.

379
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:37,705
DNA.

380
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,690
"No matching data"?

381
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,040
Hang on.

382
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,000
- The order.
- The order?

383
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,150
I guess this is right.

384
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:49,930
DNA, the order?

385
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,580
What does it mean?

386
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,715
Let's go back there.

387
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:55,300
[Team A leaves the steel bars empty-handed]
Let's go back.

388
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,040
- This is driving me crazy.
- What's this and what's that?

389
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:01,880
This is B! We're at the wrong place.

390
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,470
[They were struggling at team B's place]
- It's B.
- Hang on.

391
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:05,585
[Frightened]
Whoa

392

No?

395
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,650
Ahhh!

396
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,115
[It's about time you got used to it...]
Come here.

397
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,100
There's no hint.
There's nothing.

398
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:30,433
Hey, hurry up!
Found anything?

399
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:31,880
[Rummaging]
There's no hint.

400
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,595
[Hobi wants to get out of here]
Here it comes.

401
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,860
Did you find a pattern code?

402
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,445
I don't know what we have to do.

403
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:43,105
If zombies were real, I'll cry.

404
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,535
There's nothing.

405
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:47,300
[Can't find the hint
that's right under their nose...]
I think we're in the wrong place.

406
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,340
No, this is the right place. I'm sure.

407
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,960
[Ran away in fear]
Weren't we supposed to do something here?

408
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,405
[The cards are mixed up]
We don't know what to do because
the cards are mixed up.

409

[3, 2, 1]
- I don't think so.
- Triple A.

[Save Hobi]

412
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:08,720

[Jin & SUGA disguised as zombies
instead of solving the mission]

414

417

That's not the one.
We...

418
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:35,025
Hang on. Do you have the tickets?

419
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:37,325
They're with you.

No? Don't play jokes on me.

421

- Great acting! You're a good actor.
- Method acting.

What's that?

441

Password.

442

- Should we climb over it?
- Can we?

443
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,400
[Not knowing that team A took the hint]
Based on my experience in escape rooms,

444
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,055
there must be a hint here somewhere.

445
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:59,165
[Complaining]
But they ruined this place.

We don't know what to do.

This is confusing.

[Where did you get that, Jin?]

470
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,530

reading the map and puzzle]

472

- Right.
- We weren't careful.
