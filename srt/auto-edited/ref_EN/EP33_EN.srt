- This is our practice room
- Our new practice room

5
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,440
I've never seen anybody attach their
mic onto their scarf

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,125
[Microphone on scarf = j-hope's fashion
philosophy]
I had to do it for the fashion

- When will you take that acorn pouch off?

8
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,565
[The acorn pouch catching attention]
I can't. This is very important

[All eyes on j-hope's acorn pouch]
- What's in there?
- Right now?

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,940
- I'm expecting something big
- Nothing?

11
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,856
- Yeah, there's nothing
- Then why are you wearing it?

choose their manito and mission]

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,270
[During the game, they must conduct
their mission without their manito knowing]

18
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,010
[If they succeed, they can receive their
manito's present. If they fail or get
caught, they can't]

and 7th place will get the penalty

for their manito]

is the best

[Young members doubting the eldest]
- You will
- What if he just packed water?

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,385
- I didn't do that
- Mine looks expensive

27
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,029
- Really?
- But when you think about it

28
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:31,264
it could be the most useless present ever

[V is suspected of being SUGA's Manito]
- He's already been caught
- I think so, too

36
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:50,095
He's my manito!

37
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:52,852
He touched his neck as soon as
he picked

38
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:54,632

to MAMA?

No, I'm going to wear it

73
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,085
[j-hope placing 6th to wear it?]
Then make sure to place 6th

74
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:43,750
You should be in the 6th place then
Go ahead

75
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,933
The one in 6th place wears that

76
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:50,088
Or maybe before the next shoot
they eat three packets of ramyeon

77
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:51,983
[RM still wants j-hope's acorn pouch]
- With a bloated face?

- And wear the shoes as well!
- I told you, I'm wearing them

- Not bad
- That's not bad

84
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:08,293

00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:23,154
- Wear your character's costume for
the next shoot
- I like that

92
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:24,984
[Too good to be a penalty?]
That's a good thing, though
It promotes your character

93
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:28,269
Wearing your own cute one
feels like promotion

94
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,694
[The 1st place's character]
How about wearing the 1st place's
character instead?
