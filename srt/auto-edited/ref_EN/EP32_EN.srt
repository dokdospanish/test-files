Don't look at the trees, look at the forest

375
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:05,695

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,195
[V was surprised]
Let's go down

503
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,920
[This is not what I expected]
- I want to keep this safe
- Hang on

504
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,600

[V is checking Jung Kook's whereabouts]
- Will you stay on the 2nd floor?
- Yes

507
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:30,473
But it's blocked

508
00:23:30,473 --> 00:23:31,978
[Disappointed]
Right

509
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,520
[Whispering]
I think I need to sneak in
to catch Jung Kook

510
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,425
If I hide for 5 more minutes, I win

511

[He's crawling all the way
to catch Jung Kook]

Oh!

519
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:10,934

[RM's confession]
I'm so scared of Jeong Hoseok

526
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,500
I've never been so scared of him like this

527
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,505
He looks crazy

528
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,785
[Back of j-hope, in search of others]

529
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:43,615
[V is coming to report to him]
Jung Kook won't use the elevator

530
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:46,655
He's staying on the 2nd floor

531
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:49,850
[Bowing]
If I catch him, I'll give
all the presents to you

In the theater?

534

Where is the star?

535
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:03,655
[Jin is searching through so carefully]
You have 1 minute left until
the end of the mission

536
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,500
Just like an angel

537

[I need to use this box]
May I insist? I'll do that

Who hid this?

557
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,590
[You took it on your own]
I was confused by this

- The thief, how many did you cut?
- Everyone's except for Jung Kook's

559
