501
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,522
[The members are amazed by kimchi japchae]
Great job
It looks yummy

502
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,790
- We can enjoy all this soon
- Hey!

503
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,551
[Showing off]
SUGA made this, and RM and Jin made this
And I made it

504
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:10,181
[He has every reason to be proud]
Tonkatsu hot pot looks great

505
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:11,998
[All done!]
We're done

506
00:20:14,182 --> 00:20:16,754
[The harmony of jjigae and fried rice
(feat. sausage)]

507
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:26,651
[The harmony of japchae and
tonkatsu kimchi hot pot]

508
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,936
Our managers are foodies

509
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:38,051
- Right
- They know all the good restaurants

510
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,136
[Let's introduce the judges, our managers]
They are in charge of our group

511
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:42,266
Our two managers

512
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:44,156
Please feel free to eat up

513
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,561
You should remember that it's a hot pot
It's not kimchi jjigae

514
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:52,052
[Appealing even before swallowing]
The key to our dish is the soup

515
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,652
The fried rice might be salty

516
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,617
He's so our manager

517
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:59,337
He always wears that BTS staff jacket

518
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:03,033
- He's known as a cold guy
- Cold?

519
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,600
I asked him if I could sleep one minute
and he said absolutely not

520
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,602
[Of course] [That's right]
He's right

521
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,532
He will evaluate it fairly

522
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,497
That's a Japanese hot pot dish

523
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:13,937
[Nodding?]
- You're so into that dish
- It's a Japanese hot pot dish

524
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:17,037
[Appealing] [Manager, my love]
- Let's see!
- Let's see!

525
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:19,147
[Team Cabbage Kimchi vs. Team Kkakdugi]
It's Team Cabbage Kimchi
versus Team Kkakdugi

526
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:22,350
I'm curious whether they will make
the same choice

527
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,498
I saw it
They chose the same dish

528
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:26,666
Did they choose the same dish?

529
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,296
[No]
- No?
- He said no

530
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:30,289
- Why would you make a moss?
- No?

531
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,882
[Where's the moss?]
- Make a fuss
- You mean, make a fuss

532
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:33,319
[That was funny]
"Make a moss"

533
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:36,352
[Summary]
It's the combination of
"my gosh" and "fuss"

534
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:39,002
[Audio director and camera director's turn]
- Audio director
- Our audio director

535
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:40,099
He has great senses

536
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,743
- His five senses are amazing
- Right

537
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:46,254
[Static sound, can you hear me?]
I love you, director
Can you hear me? Love you

538
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:47,778
[No need for words]

539
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:50,185
[Good]
He nodded

540
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,140
[Nod]

541
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,644
[Applause]

542
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,555
[Jumping to a conclusion]

543
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,326
Thank you, sir

544
00:22:01,326 --> 00:22:02,748
[Acting cute]

545
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:07,558
Our Solomon!

546
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,103
He's the top commander

547
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:12,414
[Having high hopes for the director]
- He directed "Bon Voyage" as well
- Right

548
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,699
He tasted it and tilted his head

549
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:17,417
[That's quite ambiguous]
It means, "How can it taste this good"?

550
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,702
- He's having another bite of hot pot
- One more time

551
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:23,083
See? Japchae from Korea, hot pot from
Japan, and bacon from Italy

552
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,283
It's three nations in one place

553
00:22:25,283 --> 00:22:26,663
[Hang on]
- Does bacon originate from Italy?
- I don't know

554
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:28,343
- Isn't it America?
- Let's say it is

555
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:33,130
[Time to announce the result]
What's the result?

556
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:35,605
[Excited]
- 4 to 1
- 4 to 1?

557
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,855
Team Cabbage Kimchi won

558
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:40,075
We did it!

559
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,235
[Whatever]
We lost again

560
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:45,350
- Is it sweet?
- I really like it

561
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,473
[The winner of Kimchi Battle]
It's the hot pot

562
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:49,493
[So excited]

563
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,845
- It became sweet
- It's simmered for too long

564
00:22:52,845 --> 00:22:54,775
It tastes like the restaurant
in Yeonnam-dong

565
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,920
[That's so specific]
- Yeonnam-dong
- There's a hot pot place

566
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,310
I lost again

567
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,680
[Strong will]
Let's have a cook-off again

568
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,192
[So busy eating it]
I'll do it properly

569
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:04,202
It's simmered too long

570
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:06,947
[Regretful]
What should we have added?

571
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:08,822
Should we have added Cheongyang peppers?

572
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:12,002
Deep, not deep

573
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:14,563
In my opinion,

574
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:18,468
all the directors voted for this team
except one manager

575
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:20,758
Isn't that too cruel?

576
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:22,420
[Eating up]
- We should wrap it up
- Let's finish up

577
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:24,678
[Take your time...]
Stop eating
We should wrap it up

578
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:29,443
We made kimchi ourselves and had a cook-off

579
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:32,293
- How was it?
- What I really want to say is

580
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:35,513
[It's good]
our dish is really good

581
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:37,363
[It's so good]
We should cook it at home

582
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:39,793
Our cooking skills are improving

583
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,728
What should we do now?

584
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:44,218
[Well... Yeah...]
We do everything so well

585
00:23:44,218 --> 00:23:46,903
- Try this, it's not evaluated yet
- Right

586
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:48,794
[Almost forgot] [Skinny figurine?]
- We should try that
- It's so skinny

587
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,399
Isn't this a figurine?

588
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:53,489
[Eat up]
It's food
Rock, paper, scissors!

589
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,149
[Suddenly, rock paper scissors?]
The losing team should eat it

590
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:56,984
[Speaking quickly]
You three can each have one

591
00:23:56,984 --> 00:23:59,260
[Eating an onion?]
Should the loser have a bite of this?

592
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,075
[Suddenly]
Rock, paper, scissors!

593
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:03,932
[Spectators]
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- The one who brings up always lose

594

- Everyone
- See? He lost

596

You said it, so you lost

597

I'll try

598
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:15,492
- Please wrap it up as I eat this
- Let's go!

599
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:17,811
[Munch!]
The cooking shows by BTS will continue!

600
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:20,071
- Run!
- BTS!

601
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:22,856
[Flooded with requests]
Shout out "Run BTS" after eating that

602
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:25,311
Run BTS!

603
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,866
[Here you go]

604
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:30,922
[Satisfied]
- Good job
- Good job

605
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,790

[Team Kkakdugi cleans up]
We should collect the food

606
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,430
I will hurry up

607
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,968
Someone should start doing the dishes
Who wants to do it?

608
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:41,098
[Rock, paper, scissors?]
- Who will do the dishes?
- Who brought it up?

609
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:42,722
Him? Me?

610
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:43,508
- You brought it up?
- Yes

611
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,508
- I think you will lose
- Rock, paper, scissors!

612
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:48,258
- No way
- No way, for real?

[Here it comes] [Paper]
- This is destiny
- Rock, paper, scissors!

[Rock]
Rock, paper, scissors!

615

[Unbelievable]
- Is it real?
- It's amazing

617

Let's clean this up first

618

You're cleaning up really nice, Jimin

619
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:07,458
I clean things very well,
but I'm not good at organizing my clothes

620
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:09,241
[The beauty of a guy with confidence]
I like cleaning, except that

621
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,756
It's not that bad compared to last time

622
00:25:12,822 --> 00:25:14,856
So many dishes were stacked up last time

623
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:18,957
[Muttering]
I can't check the temperature
I should rinse with hot water
