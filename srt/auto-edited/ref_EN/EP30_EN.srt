[What?]
The sword recognizes its master.

44

Let's each suggest a penalty.

[Suggesting an idea]
As we're dressed in the 80s style,

82

from that era?

83

wearing these.

for penalty?

- And going straight to Macao like this?
- I think

98
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,417
[No! Let's wear it when we depart]
I think we should wear it when we depart.

on their way to the airport.

100

[We know that]
- That's why it's a penalty.
- I admit.

101

[Confident]
If you don't like it, win the game.

- So, the penalty is decided.
- Departure or entry?

117
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,678
But the MC has a point.

118
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:08,753

[MC SUGA will pick one team and
follow the result of that team]

120

[It's not fair]
Why are you dragging me into this?

121
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:16,595
Because you choose one team.

- Don't show the team name.
- Give it to the crew.

Give it to them.

125

- Show the team name.

Don't change it.

129

It's going to be fun
if he chose the losing team.

[He chose this belt by himself]
You chose it yourself.

143

dress in retro style...

00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,915
[Team Glasses already shouted]
You said Team Glasses.

482
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:51,295
[Just guessing] [Bingo]
- No.8 Hanseong.
- Correct.

483
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,965
[I won!]

484
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:55,495
[Lying down]
You gave him a chance.

485
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,845
Now, Jung Kook can point to his opponent.

486
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,850
Can I do it like Hobi?

487
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,885
[Hobi style]
Park Jimin, come on out.

488
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:03,565
[I'm older than you]
Talk in honorifics.

489
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,945
About just now,

490
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:08,501
[Current score 1:1]
I want to apologize.

491
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,661
- Hang on. Did you know it's 1:1?
- From now on,

492
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:13,526
the questions are a bit challenging.

493
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:14,861
[Challenging?]
Is it difficult?

494
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:17,011
[Ready]
- The questions are difficult.
- Oh, my.

495
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:20,736
In the police station episode
of "RUN BTS"...

496
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:22,836
- Do you remember that?
- I do.

497
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:25,976
Jin was charged with two crimes.

498
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:31,121
[I know]
- I know.
- What was the crime?

499
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:33,000
This is too difficult.

500
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,906
- Was there a name to the crime?
- Is it a short-answer question?

501
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:36,781
[Multiple choice question]
This is a multiple choice question.

502
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:38,961
[Hearing for the first time]
- I can't remember.
- No.1.

503
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:41,101
For being world wide handsome.

504
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,981
[I love it]
- That makes sense.
- Reasonable.

505
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:46,971
No.2. For having a crazy handsome look.

506
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:49,141
- That sounds nice.
- That's plausible.

507
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:50,726
[Too long]
- Can you even remember the choices?
- That's what I'm saying.

508
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:53,816
- The one who can remember will win.
- The second crime?

509
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,296
- Yes.
- Oh.

510
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,996
No.3. Acting like a dad.

511
00:20:57,996 --> 00:21:00,825
[Feeling accused]
I've never done that. Don't look at me.

512
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:05,720
No.4. For stealing ARMY's hearts
with his broad shoulders and handsome face.

513
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,375
[That's it]
Jung Kook!

514
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,880
[Jung Kook raised his cushion]
- Jung Kook, no.4.
- Jimin! Raise it!

515
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,980
[Confused]
- Team Glasses.
- What was it?

516
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,995
[Not allowed to share the answer]
Don't say.

517
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:15,740
[The player needs to answer on his own]
Don't help him.

518
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,710
With his broad shoulders...

519
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,995
Kim Seokjin!
No.4!

520
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:23,675
With his broad shoulders,
he stole....

521
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:26,160
[Hint]
Jung Kook, the prepositional
particle was wrong.

522
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,325
- Team Glasses!
- I know!

523
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:31,429
[What was that...]
Can't remember.

524
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:33,956
[Kind SUGA's replay]
- Crazy.
- Let me read the choices again.

525
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:38,641
No.4. For stealing ARMY's hearts
with his broad shoulders and handsome face.

526
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:40,836
- Kim Seokjin!
- Team Glasses!

527
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:42,511
[Raising the cushion]
- Team Kim Seokjin!
- Team Glasses!

528
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,936
Jimin said it faster, to be honest.

529
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,856
[Was it that obvious?]

530
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:50,936
[Proud]
- You need to get it exactly right.
- For stealing the hearts of ARMY

531
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,047
with his broad shoulders and handsome face.

532
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:55,217
[Merciless]
- Team Glasses!
- Wrong!

533
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:58,757
- I know.
- For bombing the hearts of ARMY

534
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:03,786
with his broad shoulders and handsome face.

535
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:05,991
Bombing...

536
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,921
[Dauntless Jung Kook challenges again]
- Why did you bomb....
- Team Glasses!

537
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:11,141
[I think this is correct]
For stealing ARMY's hearts with

538
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:13,201
- his broad shoulders and handsome face.
- There you go!

539
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,891
- Wrong.
- No?

540
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:17,351
[Surprisingly]
We have 7 choices.

541
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:19,891
[What?]
- Why not...
- This isn't the answer?

542
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:22,071
- Why are you spending all your energy now?
- Team Glasses!

543
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:23,991
- Is it acting like a dad?
- Acting like a dad.

544
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:26,191
- Which number?
- No.3. Acting like a dad.

545
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:27,345
- Wrong.
- I guess that's not it.

546
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,345
No.5. For being super handsome.

547
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:32,006
[Everything sounds like the answer...]

548
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:34,526
Team Glasses!
No.5, for being super handsome.

549
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:37,056
[MC is trying to give hints]
It's about time for the real answer.

550
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,096
No.6.

551
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:42,261
Oh, I'm an old man over 40.

552
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:45,956
[What's that?]
This...

553
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:48,351
[He himself is surprised]
- This is not it.
- Of course not.

554
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:50,231
- I know.
- Kim Seokjin.

555
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:54,338
No.6, Oh, I'm an old man over 40.

556
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,578
- Wrong.
- Team Glasses.

557
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:58,783
- No.1! For being world wide handsome.
- Wrong.

558
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:01,033
- This was before the Billboard event.
- Right.

559
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:03,992
No.7. Min Yoongi.

560
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,384
[This is it!]

No.8.

564
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,564
You said we have 7 choices.

565
00:23:13,564 --> 00:23:15,304
- Did you lie?
- No.8.

566
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:21,453
Old maaan.

567
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:25,336
- Jeon Jung... Team Glasses!
- Jim... Kim Seokjin!

568

[What's wrong with them?]
- Team Glasses!

[Right?]
No.9, Old man.

580

[Ding Dong]

581
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:59,556
- What's the difference?
- No.8 was maaan.

582
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:03,506
- Maaan?
- No.9 was man.

583
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:04,961
Man.

- No.8 was Man?
- It was maaan.

585
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:09,896
- Then, no.3 was dad?
- It was just dad.

586
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:12,346
Please pick the next opponent.

587
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:14,401
[Jung Kook is tired]
This is tiring.

588
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:16,136
Jin, you should go.

589
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:18,034
Next question.

590
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:25,450
What is the title of the song that RM,
Jin, and Jung Kook sang during the MT episode?

591
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,240
- OK.
- Short-answer question?

592
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,500
[No! This is a multiple choice question]
This is also a multiple choice question.

593
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,795
- Multiple choice.
- Let's try.

594
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:32,585
[The members encourage him to take a guess]
- Just take a guess.
- You know the answer.

595
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:33,945
[Thud]

596
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,525
[Jin takes a wild guess.

No.2. Sound of Wind.

606
00:24:59,345 --> 00:25:03,305
[Fake?]

to say the right option.

607
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:06,320
[It's not]

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,260
[Amazed by SUGA's great MC skills]
The previous one was "Memory of the Wild."

619
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,775
What's that?

620
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:50,945
[You're really doing this to us?]
What's that?

621
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:53,555
[Even he finds it funny]
No.8 was Memory of the Wild.

622

- No.9!
