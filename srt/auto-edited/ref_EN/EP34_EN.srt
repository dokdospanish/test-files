[Wrong]
- Wrong
- It isn't him?

474
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,832
[SUGA guesses V!]
- SUGA?
- V

475
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:01,352
[SUGA guessed wrong too]
No? Why not?

476
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:03,682
- It wasn't him
- Wow

477
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:06,632
[Counting his chickens first]
- Is it me?
- I think it's V or Jin

478
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,132
[Not sure]
I think it's Jin or V...

479
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:11,062
I don't think any of us will
guess correctly

480
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,994
I think it's V!

481
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:15,074
[Wrong]
It's Jin

482
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,059
[You only got it now?]
What about V?

483
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,029
[V guessed Jung Kook]
I guess Jung Kook

484
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,331
[Yeah..]
- Wrong
- No one is getting it

485
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:23,606
[Jimin thought it was SUGA or V]
I thought it was either SUGA or V

486
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:26,186
- Why am I so popular?
- V was going around to everyone

487
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:27,289
[Wink]

488
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,439
[Jimin selects SUGA!]
I think it's SUGA

489
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:30,529
[Wrong]

490
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:33,364
[Hesitant]
- Jung Kook, let's go!
- I know who it is...

491
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:35,789
[Tell us]
- You're worried you won't get the prize?
- Just guess

492
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:37,604
[It's you...]
Me?

493
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:39,104
[Talking with his eyes]

494
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:42,169
- He was like that to everyone
- Come on and tell us

495
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:43,709
[Jung Kook thinks...]
- Tell us
- V

496
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:45,734
[Wrong!]
It wasn't him? Really?

497
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:48,398
[Will Jin say V, too?]
- Say V, too
- Will Jin be correct?

498
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:49,373
Jung Kook

499
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,208
[No one guessed correctly]
Everyone was wrong?

500
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,173
I was Jimin's manito

501
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:55,253
[Surprised]
- Really?
- My mission was so easy

502
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:58,903
[Mission was to make a V behind Jimin]
It was to make a V behind him

503
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:03,218
[RM succeeded easily]

504
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:05,373
[So many times...]

505
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:08,973
[Mission clear!]

506
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:10,248
[So jealous]
That's so easy

507
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:12,990
[Upset]
Come on, that was too easy

508
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,900
[Everyone is jealous of his easy mission]
- So I did it like 7 times
- He picked well

509
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,113
[Saddened] [Upset] [Smiles]
You all picked it yourselves...

510
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:20,053
[Everything was fate]
- Then you should have picked it!
- The staff like RM

511
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:21,433
[SUGA's manito was V]
I had V

512
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:23,403
It was to make a heart next to V

513
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:25,143
[Mission clear!]

514
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,618
[Upset]
- That was easy too
- The director must like SUGA

515
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:29,359
[Really?]
I think so

516
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,633
[Mission was to high five with his manito]
My mission was to high five

517
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:35,532
Is that why you kept doing it to me?

518
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:37,152
[Bingo]
My manito was RM

519
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:41,097
[Once, twice, three times]

520
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:42,877
[Everyone's mission was so easy]
Yours were all easy

521
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:44,477
- You do that all the time
- We do it all the time

522
00:22:44,477 --> 00:22:45,802
[It was so easy to do]
He always high-fives people

523
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:49,757
- I thought everyone had
difficult missions like me
- Me too! Mine was hard

524
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:52,057
But we couldn't make it so obvious

525
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:54,652
[He had a plan in doing his mission]
But I had to be secretive about mine

526
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:56,531
I tried to trick everyone

527
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:57,916
[V's manito was Jin!]
My manito was Jin

528
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,706
[Mission]
I had to hear, "You're smart" from him

529
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:03,021
- Jin, I was smart, right?
- Yes, you were smart

530
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:05,592
[V's mission was hard but he did it well]
- That was really hard
- Wow

531
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,392
[Haha]
V is good at this kind of thing

532
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:10,192
[Jimin doesn't sound confident]
My manito was Jung Kook

533
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:13,707
[Had to make a heart with Jung Kook]
I gave up because we had to
do a heart together

534
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:14,902
That was hard

535
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:16,922
[Didn't you do it earlier?]
You did it earlier

536
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:18,297
[With V...]
He did it with me

537
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:21,937
[Oh]
Oh no! You should have called him out!

538
00:23:21,937 --> 00:23:24,336
[It hurts so much...]
You should have been smarter about it

539
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:26,486
Just do it now

540
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:27,836
[Heart]

541
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:29,796
[Jimin put a lot of thought into it]
Was that why you asked me?

542
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:31,301
I told him that people made
hearts like this

543
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:32,821
[Not sure]
I'm not sure if it was
caught on camera or not

544
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:33,837
I did it though

545
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,761
[Was it filmed...?]
We did it, but the directors were
holding a meeting at the time

546
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:39,711
[It made it on camera]
- People make hearts like this
- Really?

547
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:42,318
[Bewildered]
[A handshake out of happiness]

548
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:43,763
[Jung Kook's manito was SUGA]
My manito was SUGA

549
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:46,653
[Mission was to lock fingers together]
- What was your mission?
- To lock hands

550
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:49,988
[Jung Kook is bold and tries his mission]
- You know me, right?
- You must be my manito

551
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:51,883
You were too obvious

552
00:23:51,883 --> 00:23:53,257
But SUGA didn't get it

553
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,919
[Reflects on himself]
I'm a fool, I don't know anything

554
00:23:58,126 --> 00:24:01,088
[Jin's manito was j-hope]
- My manito was j-hope
- And your mission?

555
00:24:01,113 --> 00:24:03,591
- I think it must have been really hard
- It was

556
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:06,571
[To hear "Stop it" from j-hope]
To hear "Stop it" from j-hope

557
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:07,856
I don't usually say that kind of thing

558
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:10,226
[That was Jin's big picture?]
That's why I kept cheating earlier

559
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:11,647
I think he said it

560
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:12,897
[Jin failed]
Don't look

561
00:24:12,897 --> 00:24:15,459
Only one person won't get a gift

562
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,114
[Jin, who will wear hanbok]
Jin, who will wear hanbok

563
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:21,940
- It hurts my heart
- He has to wear hanbok
and won't get anything

564
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,585
[I feel so bad for him]
It makes me so sad

565
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,080
[Time for gifts]
RM will get j-hope's gift

566
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,220
[Gift prepared by j-hope]
- That's mine, right?
- Yes, is it underwear?

567
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,080
- It's underwear
- SUGA will get Jung Kook's

568
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,013
SUGA, you can guess what it is
by the size, right?

569
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:36,193
[What is it?]
- It's a diffuser
- Diffuser

570
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:37,257
[I see]

571
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:39,717
Jin's gift will go to j-hope

572
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:42,915
[What is it?]
- Lucky j-hope
- Jin!

573
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,586
[What is it? He can't contain himself]
Wow!

574
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:46,246
[Cheers]

575
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,165
What is that? Is that a fridge?

576
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:51,545
[Of course]
- Do you think I'll like it?
- Yes

577
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:53,705
[What is it? The staff bursts out
laughing at SUGA's gift]
V will get SUGA's

578
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:55,715
[V will like SUGA's gift]
- What is this? A book?
- You'll love it

579
00:24:55,715 --> 00:24:57,480
[What is it?]
- Isn't it our album?
- No

580
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,645
- It's RM's
- The best gift

581
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:02,135
[What is it?] [Acting like he doesn't know]
- SUGA...
- What?

582
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:04,779
[Jimin -> Jung Kook]
This is Jimin's
It's heavy, what is it?

583
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,864
[The staff decide to give Jin
something too]

584
00:25:06,864 --> 00:25:09,807
[Yes]
- We all think he should get one
- Thank you

585
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:11,632
[Time to open]
Let's go one by one

586
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:14,912
[Excited] [Jin opens V's gift]
- Jin first
- I got something nice

587
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:16,704
[Everyone is amazed at V's gift]
- Wow!
- Wow!

588
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:19,148
A cactus!

589
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,810
[Looking closely]
- Cacti are cool
- So pretty

590
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,860
[Nice for decorating]
They're good for decoration

591
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,190
[I want it]
It's so unique

592
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,890
None of us have plants in our rooms

593
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,892
But I wanted to get a cactus

594
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,983
[And that someone is me?]
and I wanted someone to grow it with me

595
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,258
[V wanted to share his cactus]
Let's grow them together!

596
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:34,488
[Perfect]
- I'm going to get one too
- This is a nice gift

597
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:35,491
So nice

598
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,976
[Jung Kook opens Jimin's gift]
- What is this?
- Underclothes?

599
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:42,275
It's much prettier than you think

600
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,865
[So curious]
- I know what this is!
- Show us! Show it to us

601
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:47,305
[Stammers]
The cat lights up after you plug it in

602
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:48,646
[So cool! A cat lamp!]
A lamp!

603
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:50,496
I like this 
I've never seen a lamp this big

604
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:52,731
[Since I'm a calico cat]
I'm a calico cat, everyone

605
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:57,037
He's promoting himself
It's worse than this

606
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,335
[Jimin got RM's gift]
- Jimin
- I got RM's

607
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:02,140
[Confident]
My gift is really practical

608
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,745
[What is RM's practical gift?]
- Thank you
- I'm going to get one for me

609
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,370
- Heat-tech underclothes
- They're underclothes

610
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,440
I tried all kinds of underclothes

611
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,901
[RM selected his gift carefully]
but those are the warmest

612
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,395
[Awesome]
- Thanks, I'll really wear them
- RM

613
00:26:13,395 --> 00:26:16,065
[What did he get from j-hope?]
- Mine is from j-hope
- What is it?

614
00:26:16,065 --> 00:26:19,000
- A mini vault?
- What is it?

615
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,310
[RM destroys things often]
Don't break it

616
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,355
- My gift is a vault
- That's a good gift

617
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:27,990
[Hold on]
- I was going to get one
- Isn't it a strange size?

618
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,340
[It's so small you can carry it]
You can just carry it whole

619
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,040
But it's unique

620
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,435
[A gift from Jung Kook]
- What is this?
- It's a diffuser

621
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:38,314
[Jung Kook's cool gift]
It's a diffuser

622
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:39,899
It's tree-shaped

623
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,684
[Everyone got a nice gift]
We all got nice gifts for each other

624
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,799
[He's getting so talkative]
Show them what it is
I want to explain mine

625
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,237
[We shouldn't be laughing but...]
- It's... Oh...
- Really?

626
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,580
[SUGA's gift is the most expensive]
It's really expensive

627
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,905
[Take pride!]
It's really expensive
You can't get it anywhere

628
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:55,392
SUGA fans

629
00:26:55,374 --> 00:26:57,849
[See you online]
I'll post this on the online market
