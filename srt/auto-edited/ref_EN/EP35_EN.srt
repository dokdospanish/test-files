00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:56,080
- It's taking forever
- How do we decorate now?

481
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,440
[Jin looks at RM's plating]
[Show us... Let's laugh together]

482
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,485
Our concept is putting everything
on this plate

483
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:05,820
- Okay?
- Yes

484
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,620
[Teasing]
You're the one to blame

485
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,220
[The plate looks too small]
- There's an empty plate
- It's okay, let's do this

486
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,266

It's strange
Why isn't it closing?

498
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:45,599

It's just you're not doing it right

499

[Requests]
Please slice it into thick pieces

505
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:05,879
Do you know why it's yellow?
Because we added turmeric powder

506
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:07,709
[Yellow meat due to turmeric powder]
To get rid of the gamey smell

507

[Question]
Why didn't you use all this?

508
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:13,303
[Making an excuse]
- You should use them all
- I just followed the recipe

509
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:15,564
Just do it
We used all of ours too

[Jimin, there's too much left]
Seriously!

515
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:29,357
Jimin came over to me and said,

516
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:33,797
"What do I do with all this?"

517
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:35,432
[What just happened]
There's a lot leftover here

518
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:38,105
Don't you think you have to use all that?

519
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:39,350
[Acting]
Huh? Where's the paste?

520
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,775
[Acting like he's sad]
The paste is gone

521
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,600
I can't serve this to our members!
It's unhygienic

522
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,159
If the teacher approves
that your kimchi is good,

523
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,543
- If she approves?
- Then we'll clean it up

00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:25,449
[His mouth moves like a robot]
It's too fresh, of course

535
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:27,374
You should let it sit to ferment

536
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:28,874
I really like the paste

537
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:31,919

for like five years when I was a kid

- She needs a lot of water
