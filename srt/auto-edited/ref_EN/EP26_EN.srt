00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,995
[Flexible Jimin begins first!]

156
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:59,235
If you touch the laser, everybody
has to start again
[Be careful]

157
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,740
Don't touch it!
[Back to the beginning if laser is touched]

158
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,450
- Don't touch it!
- If anyone does, everyone starts again

159
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,835
Don't touch the laser
Jimin, let's go!

160
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:09,160
- Jimin!
- Keep going!

161
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,705
Jimin!
[Working hard]

162
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:13,565
Jimin, be careful!
[Struggling] [Following behind]

163
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:14,975
Okay, great

164
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:18,039
Don't touch it, go lower
[Jimin arrived among the mess] [Loud]

165
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,759
- Lower your head
- Sorry

166
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,759
- Don't touch it
- Lower your head

167
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:28,716
[Pressed the button but nothing happens]

168
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:31,616
- It's up there
- Where?
[Is it this one?] [Fumbling around]

169
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:34,326
[Just then!]

170
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:37,026
- No!
- It wasn't me!

171
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:38,846
[Jin's card touched the laser beam]

172
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:41,981
- Hey, come back!
- Come back
[Louder because he's embarrassed]

173
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:45,092
Let's do it again
[Back to the beginning!]

174
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:47,777
Hurry up, there's no time
[Slide]

175
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:51,926
Go faster because we have no time

176
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:53,602
[Reliable ace Jimin arrived quickly]

177
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:58,445
- It's you, j-hope!
- Ugh!
[Working hard] [A mess]

178
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,475
- Really
- j-hope, it's you!

179
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:03,545
j-hope...
[Will they pass within sometime today?]

180
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:05,849
How many times are we doing this?

181
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:09,307
Carry j-hope on your back
[Out of breath from laughing]

182
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:12,962
How many times am I going back and forth?
[Perfectly passing through now]
[One with the floor]

183
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:14,852
I arrived, hurry up
[Laughing]
[Because they were caught in the laser...]

184
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:15,812
Hurry up!
[Laughing again]
[Because they weren't caught in the laser]

185
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:16,611
[Laughing machine]
[Every moment was great]

186
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:19,061
[Bright]

187
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,482
[Almost crying]
[Pressing again]

188
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:25,022
Jin!
[Last one left, Jin] [Close]

189
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,772
Jin!

190
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:27,987
Why? I didn't touch it

191
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:31,037
[I'll do what I want regardless]
[Serious]

192
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,862
If you have short legs, you won't
be able to pass this

193
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:36,660
3030
[Team Jin would have been in trouble
if it weren't for Jimin]

194
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,491
3030
[Clumsy]

195
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:41,008
- It's opening
- We're here
[Team Kim Seokjin finally exits!]

196
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:41,758
[Scanning]

197
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:44,463
Hurry up
[All stages complete after the last scan!]

198
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:45,299
[Scanning]

199
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:50,747
- It was nothing
- What?
[All stages are over] [The trio escaped]

200
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:53,142
It was a mess inside
[Confident]

201
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:54,403
It was nothing

202
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,398
Can you see the scores right away?
[Checking their scores]

203
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:58,425
[BTS Secret Agent]
[Team Kim Seokjin / Scores]

204
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,957
[Jin - 350 points, j-hope - 290 points
Jimin - 330 points] [Total: 970 points]

205
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:03,351
- Let's go
- Is 350 a high score?
[Second Team: Team A]

206
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:04,812
Are they going before us?

207
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:06,442
- We could have gotten a perfect score
- Okay
[Confident]

208
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:10,363
Everyone...
[While Team A is getting ready]

209
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:12,980
Two people have gotten the red level
[Team Kim Seokjin]

210
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,162
Two of us?
[Anticipation]

211
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:15,822
Red means more than 300 points
[Correct]

212
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,092
Two got the red level
Jin and Jimin
[High-five!]

213
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,732
You got blue
[What about me?]

214
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:22,882
Everyone, there are levels, look
[MASTER LEVEL depending on scores]

215
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:26,417
White, yellow, green, blue, red and black

216
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,967
Like the Taekwondo belts
[Focused]

217
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,177
White, yellow, green..
[Color levels where higher the level
the darker the color like Taekwondo]

218
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:32,567
- Nobody got the black level
- Black level is like the master

219
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,677
- If you want the black level
you have to go in alone
- Really?

220
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:36,042
We started fighting as soon as we walked in
[The reason is...]

221
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:38,606
"Get out of my way!"
[Like this]

222
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:40,732
Don't we need to move on?
[A lively review from someone
who's experienced it firsthand]

223
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:43,032
Hey, we're a team!

224
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:46,462
- We're a team!
- No, this is an individual battle
[Can't tell if they're a team or not]

225
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,392
Let's go

226
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:50,372
Let's see what scores they get
[Self BGM] [Already being secret agents]

227
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,762
[Not nervous]
[V and SUGA walking in confidently]

228
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:56,057
We can say this. Since there were
three of us, we were at a disadvantage

229
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:58,297
There are places inside where
you need to place your phone
[The place to scan the M-kit]

230
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,997
They're all placed together
[Located tightly together]

231
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:01,127
So, we...
[I see]

232
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:02,924
- The three of us
- Our faces were all together
[Perfectly reenacting]

233
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:04,938
Against the wall...
[Like this]

234
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,919
[They became one with the wall]
[Close together]

235
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:11,960
We were up against the wall
like this

236
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:13,982
We were like that

237
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,675
The three of us were pressed together

238
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:22,452
- I want to see it like this
- He's still playing a game
[Sits down] [Perfectly natural]

239
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,807
Scan it

240
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:27,432
Aren't you supposed to scan it?
[Powerful] [In a rush]

241
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:29,612
- Where?
- Here
[Confused]

242
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,042
Here, at first...
[Watching it live] [Standing around]

243
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:34,652
- My face got pressed
- Right

244
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:37,327
- Jung Kook is watching
- I can't see anything
[Excuses?]

245
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,517
You shouldn't do that

246
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,632
- You have to be fair
- I'm just curious
[Curious]

247
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,172
Jung Kook...

248
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,997
What if someone gets injured...
[Incoherent speaking]

249
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:48,080
What if someone gets injured?
[What's he saying?]

250
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,147
He wants someone to get injured?
[I think he wants someone getting injured]

251
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:51,214
[Embarrassed]

252
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:53,632
They just walked in
[Live streaming] [Fumbling around]

253
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,417
What's this?

254
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:56,922
It's BTS
[The paper from picking team]

255
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,510
Oh, it's BTS

256
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,089
- Let's change it to Brain
- I folded it up

257
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:01,808
- Brain sounds better
- Okay, brain
[Changing their team name?]

258
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,217
- Or Bingsman
- Bingsman

259
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:05,757
Where do we shoot?
[Team A is also confused]

260
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:06,857
[This way]

261
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:09,387
We have to move this way?
[Shoot]

262
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:12,374
You take care of this area
[Trustworthy] [V taking care of SUGA]

263
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:15,935
- Where?
- Where are the targets?
[Team A confused but staying calm]

264
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:17,169
Where are other targets?

265
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:19,009
I don't know. Why aren't their
colors changing?
[Just shoot]

266
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,715
[Skills of someone who enjoyed
shooting games before]

267
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:24,137
They are working hard
[Worried]

268
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:26,272
I've never done escape rooms before
[Inexperienced person 1]

269
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:28,737
V shoots at the targets SUGA already shot
[Laughing at Team A's actions]

270
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:29,842
Are they fighting?
[Curious]

271
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:32,119
- They're fighting?
- They will eventually
[His own experience?]

272
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,252
There are 59 seconds left
[Shoot]

273
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:37,057
It feels like I'm cutting weeds

274
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,992
There are 15 seconds
We need to go on
[Must move to the next location in 15 sec]

275
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:43,297
Here, the next area

276
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:45,892
Move on, there you go

277
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:48,632
[Dark]

278
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:50,787
It's here
[Team A carries out the mission calmly
unlike what everyone expected]

279
00:11:50,787 --> 00:11:52,917
We have to find M
[Slowly understanding the game rules]
[Perfectly understood]

280
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,077
You're good at this
[Impressed]

281
00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:58,072
[Second zone]
[Enter the completely dark room]

282
00:11:58,072 --> 00:11:59,182
It's completely dark

283
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:01,022
It's very dark

284
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:02,912
- Here it is
- I can't see anything
[Can't see] [It's dark]

285
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:04,412
Hang on
[Enthusiastic V and SUGA who can't walk]

286
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,872
What's this?
[Touching the air]

287
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,082
It's funny now that I'm watching it
[Relaxed as they're finished]
[Funnier now that they're watching]

288
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:09,857
V

289
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:11,702
V, poor thing
[His enthusiasm stands out
even in the dark]

290
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:14,672
I want to film this, where's my phone?
[Touching around]

291
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:16,898
They're relatively quiet
[Team A quieter than the previous team]

292
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:18,606
[Turning the camera]
[Laughing]

293
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:20,461
He's turning off the camera

294
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:22,151
Why is he doing that?

295
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:25,101
He's doing it for purpose
[I got it]

296
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:26,824
He's doing it because of the light
[He's smart]

297
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,106
They're breaking the rules
[Protesting]

298
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:32,452
I can't see the cameras, though
[V continuing to touch the cameras]

299
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,282
You can use this light
[V's cute cheating]

300
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:37,012
M, M
[Found it!]

301
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:38,612
- M
- How do you scan this?
[Finally found M!]

302
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,215
Where is it?
[Touching around]

303
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:43,871
- It's here
- Here?
[Hawaiian Couple] [Not their first time as a team]

304
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,397
- Why does it suddenly work for me?
- Wait, we can't touch all the V's
[Patting around]

305
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:50,867
[I can feel it]
[There must be something here]

306
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:56,482
Here it is
[V & SUGA finding it rather easily
in the dark]

307
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:57,232
Done?

308
00:12:57,232 --> 00:13:00,057
- I got it
- You did?
[Thanks to SUGA] [Finished scanning the M]

309
00:13:00,522 --> 00:13:03,352
If they touch the camera again
they should get some kind of penalty
[Observing their behavior]

310
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:05,302
[V turned the camera again]

311
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,242
- They're breaking the rules
- He did it again

312
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:08,617
Did they break the rules?
[What rule did they break?]

313
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:12,266
They're using the camera lights
[Team Kim Seokjin agitated by
V's cheating]

314
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:17,189
- He's turning on the light
- It's the third time already
[Caught him in the act]

315
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:19,512
This is the third time
the camera director is closing it

316
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,137
This should be minus 10 points
for each time

317
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:22,867
They need some kind of penalty
[Everyone appealing for points being
taken off]

318
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,687
- Do you accept?
- You should accept this, director

319
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:29,132
It's a dark room, so they shouldn't
be using the camera light
[Firm]

320
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:30,592
The producer accepted it
[Staff agreed to take off points]

321
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:34,162
- Here
- Let me know
[The two communicating without knowing]

322
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:36,432
Where? Hurry up

323
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:38,657
This is a V!
[Told him the wrong one] [What is this?]

324
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:40,142
We're not supposed to scan the V
[Points taken off]

325
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,252
Aren't I supposed to?

326
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:44,512
[Even touching the ceiling]

327
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:45,912
Nothing on the ceiling?

328
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,442
We have to hurry up
[Must move to the next stage]

329
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:49,849
V, come here
[Hurry up]

330
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:56,381
[Starting the next stage by scanning
the M-kit]
[In a rush]

331
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,529
Is it something scary again?
[Close to tears]

332
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:00,023
This looks easy

333
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:02,280
Mine's the one with a hat

334
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:06,673
[Team A also struggling amidst
the many portraits]

335
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:07,632
[Surprised]

336
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:09,332
[Looking around]

337
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:11,097
Here it is
[Found it]

338
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
Why isn't it working?
This is right

339
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,532
Why are there so many doors?

340
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:18,652
- What's this?
- This is right

341
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:21,283
Try opening it up
[Portraits on the other side of the door]

342
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:23,042
There are two more here

343
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:27,371
Why isn't it working? Work
[Acting cute towards the portrait]

344
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:29,617
There's no person
[I can't find the person I'm looking for]

345
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:32,437
This is right, though
I want to take it off the wall
[Team A struggling in the third stage]

346
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,862
Hang on. This one is right
[Nothing here?]

347
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:37,477
- There's no skull
- Let's find the one with two people
[Sob]

348
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,454
Skull
[Can't find the skull picture]

349
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:41,671
Skull

350
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,258
There's no skull

351
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,883
This one...
[V standing in front of the mirror]

352
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,052
Here it is
[Found it]

353
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,612
Where?
[SUGA rushing at the news of the skull]

354
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:50,507
This one

355
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:52,734
- Was it there?
- Yes, this is the one

356
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:54,653
Oh, so this is how it works
[V figured it out too late]

357
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,477
This is how it works
[Eureka! He figured it out, too]

358
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:01,237
- 20 seconds
- We need to move on
[In a rush] [Not enough time left]

359
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:02,380
Let's go
[Flailing around]

360
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,062
We have 15 seconds left

361
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:05,524
[Passionate]
[I can't give up]

362
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:09,167
[Caster Jimin is broadcasting live]

363
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,752
They're here
[Arrived]

364
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:12,572
They just entered the last room

365
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:14,107
They're crowded together like us
[Looks just like us]

366
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,397
Are they fools, too?

367
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,628
They're doing the same thing

368
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:19,005
- This is hilarious
- This is the funniest
[Right up his alley]

369
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,608
Jung Kook will like this
[Me?]

370
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,620
I don't know how many times
I went back and forth
[Allowed to talk about it]

371
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,946
He was the worst, but he kept
saying things to us

372
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,046
I was dumbfounded myself

373
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:30,875
I could have gone on my own

374
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,348
[Team A is carrying out the last mission]
[Working hard]

375
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,395
[V touched the laser
as soon as he started]

376
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,004
[Crawling]

377
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,795
Can't we just go through
if we touched the laser?

378
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:43,065
- No, we have to start again
- From the beginning?
[This team is also uneasy from the start]

379
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:44,785
[Laughing out loud]

380
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:46,648
Why?
[Tell me]

381
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:49,847
- They don't know how to do it
- You need to try this yourself

382
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,015
It's a relief I figured it out
[Good thing we figured it out then]

383
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:53,278
Otherwise, we would have never know

384
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:55,207
- What is it?
- What?
[Curious] [Unknown world to them]

385
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,372
What's going on?
[Feet stomping]

386
00:15:56,397 --> 00:16:01,402
[Look at them]
[They're filming "Mission Impossible"]

387
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,927
I'm so curious
[They're super curious]

388
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:05,532
SUGA is so cute
[So cute]

389
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,797
[SUGA is confidently failing]

390
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:10,802
They didn't tell us the password
Where is it?
[Confused]

391
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,922
Just press it
[Do I just press this?]

392
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,413
Come back here
[Come back]

393
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:16,123
I guess we touched the laser
Come back

394
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:18,765
Okay
[Decide to calmly restart]

395
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:20,065
Oh, this is how you press it

396
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:23,437
[Working hard]
[V is crawling with his necklace
in his mouth]

397
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:27,911
Hurry up. There you go, jump
[Restarting the mission with help from
instructor SUGA]

398
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:30,337
[Camera is crooked after
bumping into V]

399
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,886
[V successfully finished!]

400
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:34,867
[But the problem is...]
[SUGA who started over]

401
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,549
Come back!
[Oh no]

402
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:40,225
No, go

403
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:41,750
We need one more person

404
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:45,462
[This scene is... "Saving Private Ryan?"]
[Working hard]

405
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,757
I got caught

406
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,893
- Done?
- Yes, done

407
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:51,718
What do I do here?
[Wants to get out]

408
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:52,819
Jump

409
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:55,478
- Jump?
- Jump!

laser beams]

[Wait for me]

414
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,289
Now...
[Are they done?]

415
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,692
Mission clear!
[Team A finishes as well]

416
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:05,912
[Exhausted]

417
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:07,072
Scan it

418
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:10,397
You need to scan it
[Team A uneasy till the very end]

419
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,847
- It was fun
- Watching is more fun
[Hehe]

420
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:14,197
Watching is more fun
[You're right]

421
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,597
- You two were really bad
- V

422
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:17,476
We saw you cheating
[There were mistakes but had good teamwork]
[Team A's score?]

423

[BTS Secret Agent
Team A / Scores]

424
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:20,336
[SUGA - 228 points
V - 300 points - 50 points = 250 points]

425
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,926
[Team Kim Seokjin's lowest score - 290
= 769 points]

426
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:24,657
There are reasons behind it
[V got 250 points for green level]

427
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:25,407
[Smiling]

428
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:26,937
V, do you know why you're green?
[Bingsman trying to get hints from
his confession]

429
00:17:26,937 --> 00:17:28,679
- Please confess
- Please confess

430
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,135
I'll confess once you go in
[Not falling for it]

431
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,067
If you go inside
he will tell us the reason
[We're not telling you]

432
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:35,107
Because you broke the rules inside...

433
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,617
He broke the rules
[Telling on his own team member]

434
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:38,302
How much was taken off?
[Anticipation]

435

- 50 points
- 50 points

436
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:42,854
The violation was too serious
[Hehe]

437
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,312
I did my best

438
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:47,287
But my score was lower than
their lowest

439
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,207
SUGA, as you're on the same team

440
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,157
we tried to reduce yours as well
But after seeing your score
[My score?]

441
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,897
We decided not to
[A sad score] [Felt bad for SUGA]
[How bad was his score?]

442
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:56,027
- It was 178 if you reduced it
- I'd be the white level
[If cut, SUGA would get the lowest level]

443
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:57,445
It's 178 points if cut
[I worked really hard...]

444
00:17:57,445 --> 00:17:58,600
I did my best

445
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,742
Next team, get ready please
[Finally, the last team] [Team Bingsman]

446
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:02,037
- Let's go
- It was fun, wasn't it?
[Excited]

447
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:04,879
Since this was the beginner's level
[Waiting]

448
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:06,349
Let's do the intermediate level now
[Confident]

449

- Let's go
- RM and Jung Kook

- Done
- Mine isn't working
[In a rush]

454
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,744
Press it. No, use your thumb

455
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:23,829
- What's this?
- Do we go through?
[Team Bingsman confused in the start too]

456
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:24,789
No

457
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:27,957
We can shoot

458
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:30,807
Oh, so this is why they say they fought
[Got it]

459
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:34,112
They're fighting, right?
[Everybody watching it live]

460
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,515
They'll shoot what's already been shot
[Statements coming together like
puzzle pieces]

461
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,949
Jung Kook is very competitive

462
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:40,463
You need to let him win
[Jung Kook manual]

463
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:43,197
This is an easy stage as long as
you get along

Between M and V...
[SUGA found STAGE 2 difficult]

465
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,987
They're confusing
[You're right]

466
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,107
That's where he broke the rules
[Dark room mission that caused
rule breaking]

467
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:50,477
You're not supposed to scan V

468
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,215
- If you do, your points get reduced
- Oh, really?

469
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,952
They're fighting
[Jimin excited over their fight]

470
00:18:53,952 --> 00:18:55,356

472
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:02,942

He's exactly like you

481
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:21,522
"Let's go"
[Perfect reenactment] [Bang bang]

You can't help it

I was almost hit by j-hope doing that
[Suddenly solemn]

485
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,513
We're entering the darkness
[Team Bingsman moved to the second area]

486
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:30,630
Go first
[The younger goes first]

487
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,069
Only M, not V

What's this?

491
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,124
Why is it going down?

492

[Feeling around]

493
00:19:42,772 --> 00:19:44,717
- How do you find this?
- You need to touch the wall

494

I'm sorry
[Sudden apology]

To the camera...

498
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,740
Touch the wall
[They're still touching around everywhere]

499
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,990
If it's V, don't scan

500
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,740
- If it's in the shape of M, scan it
- In the shape of M?

501
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,280
Where are V and M?
[Jung Kook hectic because he's looking

Here it is
[Grab] [Found it]

520

I think we've scanned everything

526
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:52,507
We're done, right?

527
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:54,788
I think we scanned them all
Let's go

I think we did it all, let's go on
[RM & Jung Kook having the easiest time]

A lady

531
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,652
We need to zoom in

Let's do this calmly

533
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:08,622
Calm down RM, you should not get excited
[Convincing himself]

RM, don't get too excited
[Don't get too excited]

535

RM's chin is sticking out

536
00:21:13,947 --> 00:21:14,967
He's so serious

537
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:17,056
When he does that, it means he's serious
[RM gets serious when his chin sticks out?]

538
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,662
Let me tell you all this
[Attention! Doctor Jimin's analysis
on RM]

539
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:20,337
There are two reasons his chin
sticks out

540
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:22,367
Either he wants to get something done
[Analysis 1]

541
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,117
Or he wants to look cool
[Analysis 2]

542
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,242
- RM is really...
- Scoring high?

543

RM will struggle in the last room
[j-hope's prediction]

544
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,832
Jung Kook may get angry in the last room
[That's right]

"Please just stay still"
[Full of dialect] [Acting like Jung Kook]

If you find a skull, tell me
[Jung Kook focused despite what they say
outside]

547
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:39,180
There's no skull here
[Where is it?]

548
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,501
I can't find it
[High difficulty]
[Everybody struggled with the skull]

549

- This isn't it
- The skull?

550

- Focus on yours, first
- Here it is

- Did you find it?
- Yes

552

But it won't scan

Zoom in on the one inside
[Smart RM is acting in STAGE 3]

554

I haven't found the skull
What should I do?
[Got it]

555
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:58,235
I can't find it

- I got 2
- Did you?

557
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,527

[Only have 33 seconds left]

558

- They're in the last room
- Last room, this is really...

565

Only one person has to go through, right?
[Huh?]

566
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:22,741
I'll go then
[That's why I'm going now]

[Agent Jung Kook going through
so smoothly]

568

[Can't tell if it looks difficult because
of his height or inflexibility...]

Is RM crawling?
[Crawling] [RM pulling together
his long limbs]
