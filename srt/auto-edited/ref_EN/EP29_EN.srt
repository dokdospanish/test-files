00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:49,705
[2017.9.30 BTS' pledge for entering

But I just remembered
I threw away the pink pants.

- It's custom-made?
- Yes, custom-made.

46

What if another member gets to
wear that custom-made item first?

47
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,830
And Jin may not even like it.

48
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:17,340
Nah, it's the heart that matters.

49

I love this thing.

162
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,805
I will bring three sets of outfits.

163
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:25,610
[First case]
If my partner is Taehyung,
this is the outfit.

164
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,490
Tuck this shirt into the pants
and wear a tie.

165
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,980
[V = Shirt, pants, tie and jacket]
I'll add a jacket, too.

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,320
[Second case]
For someone whose frame is similar to mine,

167
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,075
[Pretty shirt]
I'll make him wear this shirt.

168
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:40,290
[The last case]
For those who are tall
and have a bigger frame like RM,

169
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,260
[Cute overall for those with a big frame]
I will make them wear this cute one.

170
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,460
- You can look forward to it.
- Really?

171
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,800
[Worrying]
His fashion style is a bit comical.

172
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,660
[Like-minded]
I don't want Jin to be my partner.

173
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,185
[Please]
Me, too. Anyone but Jin.

174
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:54,800
I'll try a chic look.

175
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,595
[Taetae language]
For Jin's birthday party... birthday gift,

176
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:03,080
this is the perfect outfit

177
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,591
[Black turtleneck is
the essential item for a chic style]

178
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,251
No.

179
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,210
[Finished with a fashionable hat]
No, no.

180
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,450
[So proud]
Done.

181
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,090
I hope you prepared an outfit
that you can wear yourself.

182
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,205
[I've tried the look before]
I've worn this exact style before.

183
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:28,660
[Me, too]
I tried them on just now too.

184
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,620
- I brought two styles I've never tried.
- OK.

185
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,060
And one that I've tried.

186
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,185
[Well-prepared]
- You brought so many things.
- A lot.

187
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:37,426
[Curious of Jimin's look]
To suit your partner's taste?

188
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,870
Or is it to suit your taste?

189
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:41,940
[I prepared...]
One is for those with a bigger frame.

190
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,355
[Jimin even considered the members' frames]
- Oh.
 The other one is for a slimmer frame.

191
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,130
[Listening]
And one is something special.

192
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,900
[Clever]
Will you choose a style depending on
who your partner is?

193
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,611
Yes.

194
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:51,205
[Acknowledging]
He's so well-prepared.

195
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:53,308
Will we get to see BTS fashion week today?

196
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:54,728
[Excited] [Cute]
- I think we're playing a game.
- Let's go!

197
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,671
[Go, go to the BTS fashion week!]
RUN BTS!

198
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:03,041
[The clothes they selected
show their distinct fashion taste]

199
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:05,336
Let's take a look at them.

200
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:08,419
[SUGA brought pajamas with a price tag]
- SUGA, are these pajamas?
- They're pajamas.

201
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:09,614
Pajamas with the price tag still on.

202
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:13,648
- Jin's and Jung Kook's catch my eye.
- Right.

203
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:15,488
The clothes are grabbing my attention.

204
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:18,058
[Jin, the worst fashion stylist]
I wish I won't have to wear Jin's.

205
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:21,718
I want to try Jung Kook's style.

206
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:26,135
[Jimin + Jung Kook's clothes = ?]
- I want to see if I can pull it off.
- How will it fit?

207
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:28,340
[Unique challenge]
- I want to take on the challenge.
- I'm curious, too.

208
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,810
[Came running to see Jin's outfit]
Hey, this is too over-the-top.

209
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,495
What's the point of this look?

210
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,820
[Hear me out]
- Hang on.
- Let him speak.

211
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:40,035
- You're going to wear all of these.
- All of them?

212
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:42,300
[Bingo]
Don't tell me we're wearing
pants over pants.

213
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,880
[He'll explain it later]
Let's hear him out later.

214
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,919
If someone wears these,

215
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,179
[Jin's outfit looks extreme from the back]
- From behind...
- It looks like you're not wearing pants.

216
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,979
I thought about that, too.

217
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:52,394
[The oldest is so caring]
- Some of us don't wear short pants.
- Right.

218
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:56,294
- So I prepared these long pants.
- Oh, no wonder he came to me and asked,

219
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:59,004
[Now I get it] [Having a mental breakdown]
"Jimin, can I borrow your leggings?"

220
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,175
[A few minutes ago]
- Jimin.
- Yeah?

221
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,035
- You can't spy on me.
- Can I borrow your leggings?

222
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:08,810
- I don't have one.
- You don't?

223
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,920
Are those long pants?

224
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,950
- No, they're capris.
- Where did you get these socks?

225
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,530
[Even his socks are pink...]
- Where did you get these?
- Do they sell socks like these?

226
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,395
[Socks that remind you of strawberry milk]
- Did you soak them in strawberry milk?
- I wore them once.

227
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:21,235
[It's OK]
- Did you?
- Yes.

228
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:22,465
[Styling is done] [Who will style who?]
Then, now,

229
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,815
we need to decide our partners.

230
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:27,875
- How will we decide our partners?
- Let's leave it to fate.

231
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,424
[Game to decide partners]
[Each member will throw a rose
with his back to the others]

232
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,111
[The member closest to the rose
will be the partner]

233
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,040
[However, if the rose hits a member,
that member will be the partner]

234
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,220
[SUGA's turn to choose his fate]
- SUGA, you go first.
- My pajamas

235
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,720
[SUGA has never worn them]
have never been worn.

236
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
Why do they look so small?

237
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,460
[Too small]
I can't wear SUGA's clothes.

238
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,985
- I can't either.
- No, it's going to fit.

239
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:42,855
[Is the size big?]
Is it a bit big?

240
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:44,284
[It fits me so it will fit you]
It fits me just right.

241
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,735
- How can I wear it then?
- I can't wear it.

242
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,845
[So confident]
But my clothes will look fine.

243
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:52,497
[Shuffling around]

244
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,430
[I'll walk my own path]
SUGA, your clothes are not popular.

245
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,890
[j-hope and V are bickering]
[Guys, stop fighting]

246
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,925
1, 2, 3.

247
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:06,783
[Drop]

248
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,883
[Who will SUGA style?] [Nervous]
Done? Can I turn around?

249
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:10,523
It's j-hope, I guess.

250
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:14,511
[Most members are saying it's j-hope]
I think it's j-hope, too.

251
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:17,200
No. From here,
the rose is close to this side.

252
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,340
[Asking for the production crew's help]
Can you make the decision?

253
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,140
Let's throw it one more time
with just Jimin and Hobi standing.

254
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,290
[Clear solution]
- Great.
- Solomon.

255
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:27,640
I don't mind getting chosen.
So why am I so nervous?

256
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,475
[1, 2, 3]

257
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:35,040
[My eyes are only on you]
Go to Jimin!

258
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,540
[Oh no]

259
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,660
[Whatever SUGA says will come true]
Is this a proposal?

260
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:45,590
[Amazed]
How did you know where Jimin was?

261
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,115
[Hobi is envious as Jimin avoided Jin]
- Congrats on avoiding Jin.
- Thanks.

262
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,075
- I'm so jealous of you.
- Thank you, everyone.

263
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:52,635
- Congrats.
- Thank you!

264
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:54,145
- Thank you!
- I'm afraid of Seokjin, too.

265
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:56,364
[The members start worrying]
But I'm scared of Jung Kook, too.

266
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,420
I think Jimin would look
great in these.

267
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,790
[SUGA will be Jimin's stylist]
This look is made for Jimin.

268
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,491
[Jimin's turn]
Let's shuffle!

269
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,455
[Getting ready]

270
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:12,940
1, 2, 3!

271
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,723
[Hehe] [Let's see]

272
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:21,372
[The rose went past the members]
[BTS referees]

273
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:23,702
[It's me?] [Jimin will be Jung Kook's stylist]
- It's Jung Kook.
- It's exactly Jung Kook.

274
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,967
- Good!
- I've never seen him in this style.

275
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:29,015
[Satisfied]
- Jimin!
- What should I dress Jung Kook?

276
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:30,638
[Lala]
Something I won't wear.

277
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,325
[The youngest is so excited to tease others]
Jung Kook....

278
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:41,140
[Jin's shadow is looming over]
When Seokjin's turn nears, I feel nervous.

279
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,470
- I hope I can be Jung Kook's partner.
- We have to be chosen this time.

280
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:45,195
We have to get chosen now.

281
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,331
[So excited] [Who will wear Jung Kook's?]
Let's see who will be his partner.

282
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,000
[Shuffling]

283
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,383
[Yup]
1, 2, 3!

284
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:55,875
[While everyone is looking forward...]
[Whish]

285
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,134
[Making a fuss]
- j-hope!
- No.

286
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:01,630
What do you mean? I was here.

287
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,170
- You two stand there.
- Two of you.

288
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,520
[Arguing]
Let's replay the video clip. It wasn't me.

289
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,585
- You must really hate Jung Kook's style...
- Jung Kook, it's SUGA!

290
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,000
[The youngest checks out SUGA's place]
[Nervous]
Will you stand there?

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,840
[Let's see]
1, 2, 3.

292
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:18,763
[SUGA? Or j-hope?]

293
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:20,980
[Ambiguous]
Hold on! Stay still.

294
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:24,830
[SUGA? j-hope?]
- Hold on.
- This is j-hope.

295
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,740
No.

296
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,200
[Do you really want to measure?]
- Let's measure.
- Let's go again.

297
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,035
The production team concluded
it was SUGA.

298
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,106
[Too excited] [What do you mean?]
It doesn't make sense!

299
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:39,351
[Jung Kook will be SUGA's stylist]
- It's next to him. How can it be me?
- You should have put your feet together.

300
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:42,405
- You should have put your feet together.
- At least it's not Jin!

301
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:45,945
[Mad]
- No.
- What's wrong with my style?

302
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:47,615
[Stammering]
I want to try it.

303
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,067
- I'll choose you.
- I want to try your look.

304
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:51,047
- I will find you.
- I want to try your style.

305
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,195
[Me]
- Who's next?
- I'll go.

306
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,025
- Your turn?
- Yes.

307
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:58,180
[For fun]
- Taehyung, I'll go first.
- Jin should go first.

308
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,673
[So nervous]
- Is it Jin's turn?
- This is exciting.

309
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:02,013
[Everyone can't stand still]

310
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:03,807
[So nervous]
I'll keep my eye on j-hope.

311
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,360
I'll keep watching j-hope.

312
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,285
[Those with partners look so relaxed]
[Nervous vs Relaxed]
They say "out of the frying pan, into the fire"

313
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:13,030
j-hope, I'm telling you
this is a blessing.

314
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,555
1, 2, 3!

315
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:19,500
[Let's see]
j-hope!

316
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,320
[Rose between j-hope and V]
- That's so ambiguous.
- Hold on!

317
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,005
[It's j-hope as he got hit by the flower]
- I think it's V.
- Hobi was hit by the rose.

318
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:29,000
[The one who loves it
and the one who hates it]

319
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,655
[As long as it's not me]
Well!

320
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,278
You put yourself into this!

321
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,960
I'm a fashionista.
Trust me.

322
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,190
- Jin! I'll dress you up nicely.
- Really?

323
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,725
[A look that only the chosen can wear] [No]
Don't you want to wear these?

324
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:45,540
Let's go.

325
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,507
[Members are busy shuffling around]

326
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:52,355
[Scared...]
Jin is on the left side.

327
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,035
He's back to the center.

328
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,290
[Amazed]
[Can he see me? How did he know?]

329
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,025
[1, 2, 3] [Ready]
Ready?

330
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,305
[It fell in front of Jin,
as if they planned it]

331
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,782
[Amazing]
Awesome!

332
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:09,462
That's awesome.

333
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:11,362
[Jin and j-hope will be
stylists for each other]
He's scary!

334
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:13,263
[Both got the partners they wanted]
We're styling each other.

335
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,303
[j-hope found Jin with his instinct]
So, are we partners?

336
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,160
[Automatically RM and V are partners]
We'll be a pair.

337
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,832
[Got it]
- Right, you two are a pair.
- Right.

338
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,855
[In front of the clothes they will wear]
- Let's get into place!
- Let's go!

339
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:23,469
[Game result]
[Jimin -> Jung Kook -> SUGA -> Jimin]

340
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:24,911
[j-hope -> Jin,
Jin -> j-hope]

341
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:25,899
[RM -> V,
V -> RM]

342
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,509
[Introducing his style]
The style I prepared will change
depending on my partner's frame.

343
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:31,879
[I am?]
But he's somewhere in the middle.

344
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,724
[It depends on Jimin]
You can dress him however you like.

345
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:35,735
[Thinking hard]
I'm mulling between two outfits.

346
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:37,694
[No... I don't think so]

347
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:40,609
[Looking forward to seeing
Jung Kook's new style]
I've never seen him wear that.

348
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:43,440
[So enthusiastic]
I want to try this style.

349
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,835
[Jung Kook in pink]
- I've never seen him in pink.
- It will look nice.

350
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:46,835
OK.

351
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:49,650
[SUGA's pajamas are now unveiled]
I finally took out my pajamas.

352
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,750
[Jimin can wear these]
I think it'll fit him.

353
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,790
- We have similar sizes.
- I think it'll fit Jimin.

354
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,574
He can go to an award ceremony in these.

355
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:57,364
[SUGA's pajamas = award ceremony look?]
It's like a tuxedo.

356
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,219
I saved it for a special day like this

357
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,739
- I've never worn them.
- Never been worn.

358
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:01,784
[Even the price tag is on]
Even the price tag is still on.

359
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:04,197
[Great]
- I hope he wears these.
- Great.

360
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:06,567
[Looking forward to hearing Jin's concept]
- Seokjin.
- My look has a concept.

361
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,767
- What's that?
- It's coziness.

362
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,342
[Can't understand]
What made you think it looks cozy?

363
00:17:12,342 --> 00:17:15,205
[Busy styling him]
- Don't you think pink layers will feel cozy?
- Why do you keep these shoes?

364
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:17,560
[What are those shoes?]
- I always wondered.
- They're old enough to get rid of.

365
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,635
[Hilarious]
It's so worn out.

366
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:21,850
[Confident]
Not worn out. They're just a bit stained.

367
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,490
[So proud]
I saved them for this day.

368
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,034
[Smelling]
Yuck!

369
00:17:26,415 --> 00:17:28,805
[Smelling]
No way. My feet never smells.

370
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:32,520
- It doesn't smell.
- I was planning on taking out some items

371
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,095
[j-hope's misery is my happiness]
but you need to wear them all.

372
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,675
- Congrats.
- This is amazing.

373
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:40,220
[The members don't understand the pants]
I can't understand.

374
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,495
[Curious]
Where did you get these pants?

375
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,465
[Fashion terminator]
Is this the end-all of fashion?

376
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:46,804
[j-hope's fashion will be unveiled soon]
- It's over.
- Fashion terminator.

377
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:50,459
Jung Kook, please introduce your style.
Do you remember these?

378
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:53,620
[Jung Kook's clothes
remind V of old memories]
It's very similar to the military costume

379
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,575
that we wore for the first
performance on "Show! Champion."

380
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,895
[They know Jung Kook's love for ensembles]
Jung Kook loves an ensemble.

381
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,990
He feels uneasy when his top
and pants are different.

382
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,090
[He needs a bag to complete the look]
He should've brought the Bon Voyage bag.

383
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,435
[Disappointed]
It's in the recording studio.
So I couldn't bring it.

384
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:10,435
Personally, I don't like the camouflage print.

385
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:12,945
[Sorry?]
- This is not camo.
- They're trees.

386
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:14,795
- This is not camo.
- They're trees.

387
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:17,886
[Jung Kook has been wearing a piece of art]
It's a piece of art, a drawing of trees.

388
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:20,296
- Right.
- Jung Kook bought an artwork.

389
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:23,546
[Next, j-hope's outfit]
- Next... These are mine.
- I can't wait to see them.

390
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:26,846
- So pretty.
- Who gave you this T-shirt?

391
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:28,857
[Jacket matched with T-shirt from Jimin]
Jimin gave it to me as a gift.

392
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:32,000
Hoseok likes to play soccer.

393
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,580
I've never worn this type of hat.

394
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,440
[The accent piece to j-hope's outfit]
- This is the best part.
- The accent piece.

395
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,720
[What's that?]
- This is the icing on the cake.
- You can't leave this out.

396
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,840
- j-hope!
- That's the accent piece.

397
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,760
- Why are these socks so...
- I got them from the laundry basket.

398
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,585
- I asked our manager and he got me these.
- They're so worn out.

399
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:51,920
[Another point to his style: Shoes]
- These are shoes?
- They're what make the outfit.

400
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,785
- There's something I don't understand.
- Yes.

401
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:56,180
[Can't understand]
- Why this bucket hat?
- It's a must-have item.

402
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,155
Because you're going fishing?

403
00:18:57,155 --> 00:19:00,130
[j-hope's look is completed with this hat]
You need to cover up your face with
this hat. That will complete the look.

404
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,420
- To cover up the eyes.
- I didn't know these shoes were so heavy.

405
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,180
[Let me hold them]
- They're so heavy, like sand bags.
- Wow!

406
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,085
I visited my parents' in these.

407
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:11,700
My dad asked why
I was wearing aircraft carriers.

408
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,945
[So heavy]
- These must be made of lead.
- That's all for me.

409
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,470
[RM's turn]
- You know, I like a challenge.
- Yes.

410
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,830
[RM has never tried this look]
But I've never tried this look.

411
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,405
- It's a bit big.
- He's wearing it himself.

412
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:25,800
[RM takes off his clothes to wear it]
Let me wear this sweater.

413
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,480
[Expert on V]
V likes clean and neat styles.
Even when he wears oversized clothes,

414
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,680
[True]
he never wears loose clothes like this.

415
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,934
When you wear this,
you won't be afraid of winter in Russia.

416
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:35,716
[Empty laugh]
You can even visit Alaska.

417
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,460
[RM's outfit has great insulation]
You could sit in front of a fireplace.

418
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,140
[RM looks bigger]
Wow.

419
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:45,760
That's an unexpectedly challenging one.

420
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,760
[RM's unexpected look]
- I didn't expect this fit.
- And then a cap to finish...

421
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,215
Wow.

422
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:52,750
[It feels like he's in Alaska]
You can sing a carol.

423
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,000
When I saw it, I thought it wasn't bad
but the fit was a real problem.

424
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,701
[So burly]
- It makes him look so buff.
- I can go to Alaska now.

425
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:01,221
[Warm]
You look like you'd read poems
in front of a fireplace.

426
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:04,308
But I truly believe that
Taehyung can pull this off.

427
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,840
[Looking forward to V's transformation]
I've never seen him wearing such a look.

428
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,390
[Excited] [V's style]
- I'll look forward to it.
- OK.

429
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:18,700
- Let's see V's outfit.
- I didn't expect Namjoon to be my partner.

430
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,760
[Combination of an oversized jacket
and slim-fitting pants]
I prepared something slim-fitting.

431
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,275
[Is this the material that I know?]
- Is this stretch fabric?
- Yes.

432
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:30,545
[The pattern of the jacket draws attention]
- Paisley pattern on a jacket...
- Right.

433
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:33,340
Taehyung is the only one
who can pull this off.

434
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,120
Let me tell you this first.

435
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,109
[FYI, this is a birthday gift for Jin]
This is a birthday gift for Seokjin.

436
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:39,506
Do I wear it first?

437
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,536
[Coughing]
- Yes.
- Seokjin!

438
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:45,161
[Coughing at the shocking news]
- No, don't do that.
- He's in denial.

439
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,701
[V continues to introduce his clothes]
There's only one of its kind.

440
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:49,240
[Quietly spitting facts]
There's only one of its kind
but RM will wear it first.

441
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:51,440
And then you'll gift it to Jin?

442
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,895
[RM is just a model]
Think of him as just a model.

443
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:56,425
Think of me as a mannequin.

444
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:59,050
- Think of him as a mannequin.
- If he doesn't like it, will you return it?

445
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,745
[The receipt left my hands]
But I threw away the receipt.

446
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,800
If I wear this to "Music Bank,"
it will be all over the media.

447
00:21:04,824 --> 00:21:05,941
- That's right.
- What would it say?

448
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:09,080
Fashionista, the best boyfriend look,
BTS Jin.

449
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,035
[Suspicious]
You always do that on
the way to "Music Bank!"

450
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:15,480
[Let's go and change]
All the looks were introduced.

451
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,080
Now we just need to wear them.

452
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,760
[While changing]
What do you think about Jung Kook?

453
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,213
Jung Kook?
- It looks great on him.

454
00:21:23,237 --> 00:21:24,040
Right?

455
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,520
- It's the boyfriend look.
- I wanted to make him look great.

456
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,345
- RM, it's a bit unique.
- That's nice.

457
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:34,880
- Do I have to tuck my collar in or out?
- In! Try to look laid-back.

458
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,860
- I think Hobi will look great in this.
- It looks nice on Hobi.

459
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,700
- V looks great.
- Pretty.

460
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,805
It feels like V is wearing RM's clothes.

461
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:47,535
It's crazy! Jin is transforming!

462
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:49,766
- Jin looks great in that.
- How do I look?

463
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,675
Cool!

464
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:53,705
SUGA, roll up your pants.

465
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:59,465
- You're so cruel.
- Belt and a beanie hat. Perfect.

466
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,005
