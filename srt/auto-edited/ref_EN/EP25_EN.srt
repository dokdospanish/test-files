I'll choose the one that looks more fun.

323
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,918
[What you like is what I like]

324
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:39,402
[SUGA says item matches are based on luck]
Because item matches aren't
determined by skills.

325
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:41,582
You need to leave it to luck.

326
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:43,057
[Nervous]
Am I right?

327
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:43,807
[Smiling]

328
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,133
[Playful V]
V just said "Yoongi talks too much"
in the chat room.

329
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:48,220
[SUGA talks too much]

330
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,593
Let's see who is the best rider.

331
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:51,973
Let's start.

332
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:53,816
[Displeased]
- What's that tone?
- Get ready.

333
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,323
[What are you doing?]
Please get ready.

334
00:12:55,323 --> 00:12:56,983
- What's with that childish tone?
- Get ready.

335
00:12:57,008 --> 00:13:00,061
[Press F5 and get ready to start!]
- Press F5 and start.
- Let's start.

336
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:01,114
[Serious]
Let's go!

337
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,528
[First round start]
The desert. I think I've seen this map.

338
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:06,406
[Legendary map]
This map is really...

339
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,771
[Anyone who played Kartrider knows this]
All you need to do is keep running.

340
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,513
[j-hope got off to a good start] [Excited]
j-hope!

341
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:12,727
[Game newbie]
If you press harder, will it start faster?

342
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:15,585
[Hope and V are 1st and 2nd runners]
Banana.

343
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,767
[Stepping on the banana]
He stepped on the banana.

344
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,589
[Team Red is concentrating]
He got shot.

345
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:21,305
Water balloon, V!

346
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,682
[Sad] [Jin shot V with a water balloon]
He got shot by a water balloon!

347
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,883
[j-hope is the first runner]
Who's the first runner?

348
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:27,123
[Locked in the spaceship]
I locked him.

349
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,451
[A totally unpredictable race]
What's that in my way?

350
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,428
It's a traffic accident.

351
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:33,017
[Hehe]
Can I fill the booster?

352
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:36,273
[Aiming for no.1] [Will Jin turn the tables?]
- j-hope, I'll catch up with you.
- He overtook him!

353
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,453
[No way]

354
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:39,970
[Disappointed]
A bomb!

355
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:41,603
I'm the worst, as expected.

356
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,526
[Jimin and j-hope are good at this]
j-hope's doing the best.

357
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,710
[j-hope crashed into V]
Good.

358
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:47,694
You better call the insurance agent.

359
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,648
[Team Red is leading thanks to the accident]
Good. No.1 and 2 are our team members.

360
00:13:49,648 --> 00:13:52,238
[Complaining]
- Who's no.1?
- I'm last place.

361
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,536
The first one is Jimin.

362
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,609
[What?]
Jimin was leading but got abducted.

363
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:58,521
[Talking so fast]
j-hope used a booster.

364
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,088
- j-hope is the fastest runner.
- I'm the fastest.

365
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,479
[Warning: You and I are on the same team]
Jimin, don't throw bananas like that.

366
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,138
[Sigh] [Jimin was shot by a missile]
He got shot!

367
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:07,262
[#Missile_Runner up_Successful]
No.2 is overtaking no.1, j-hope.

368
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:10,026
[I hate the missile]
That missile got me so behind.

369
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:12,577
[I will win!]
[j-hope is speeding up]

370
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:15,823
[Jin lost the no.1 spot due to the missile]
[Way to go, my team!]
j-hope!

371
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:18,556
[Wow!]
j-hope, all you have
to do is cross the line.

372
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:23,155
[Round 1: Team Blue won!]

373
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,666
[Jung Hoseok / 24  (Professional handler)
I'll always be no. 1]

374
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:28,554
[Disappointed]
We lost.

375
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:31,304
[Taetae is happy his team won]

376
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,358
[Team Blue won contrary to expectations]
Team Blue won!

377
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:35,508
It's amazing.

378
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,411
[Excited V] [I see]
Jimin, you couldn't finish the race?

379
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:40,210
[Ranking of round 1]
[j-hope, V, Jin, RM, Jung Kook, Jimin]
Jimin, I can't believe you retired.

380
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:41,913
[Jimin couldn't finish the race]
- Jimin, you couldn't finish it?
- Really?

381
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:42,967
[All I can do is smile]
Jimin!

382
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:44,447
[Match like a scene from a movie]
It was so dramatic.

383
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:48,047
[MC's commentary]
[Missile, the key to turning the tables]
Team Blue turned the tide with a missile.

384
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:50,122
[Emphasizing]
I shot behind them.

385
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:56,473
Jin's team needs to try harder.

386
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:58,043
[Discouraged]
They haven't gotten the hang of it yet.

387
00:14:58,043 --> 00:15:01,078
As I said, round 2 is a speed match.

388
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:02,613
[Bring it on]
We need to play a speed match.

389
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:04,653
[I am so confident]
- Let's play that.
- Let's have the match.

390
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:07,958

confident in the speed match.

391
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,038
[Self-proclaimed no.2 Team's speed king]
I'm our team's no.2 in the speed match.

392
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:10,918
Are we switching to the speed match?

393
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:13,980
[Current score 1:0]
Since everyone's ready, let's get started.

394
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:16,960
[Team Red showed confidence in the speed match]
- Speedy commentary, good.
- Jin's team said

395
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,217
[Serious]
- they're confident in the speed match.
- It's 1-0 now.

396
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:20,953
[Not confident]
I'm not good at this map.

397

[Drift skills matter in the speed match]

401
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:32,603
[V's car bumped into the guardrail]
The speed match... Oh, he's going back.

402
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:33,923

j-hope is amazing.

403

j-hope is the ace.

j-hope is the ace.

00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:46,139
[Surprised] [Landscape mode]
What's this? My screen rotated.

410
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,679

Jung Kook, stop hitting me.

411
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,758
[Someone take notice...

412
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:50,402
- j-hope is leading.
- Jimin...

413
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:54,298
- Why are you with me?
- My screen flipped 90 degrees.

414
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:55,963
[Acting cute]
Can we start over?

415
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:58,108
[No way]
- That's not going to happen.
- No way.

416
00:15:58,631 --> 00:15:59,751
[Upset]
What's wrong with this?

417
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,168
[Struggling]
[I'll keep playing anyways]

418
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,059
[Teasing]
Jimin, are you behind me? Awesome.

419
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:05,673
I'll catch up with RM.

420
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,083
[Staring]
- I caught up with RM.
- Hang on.

421
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,453
[While Jimin is struggling with his monitor]
j-hope is moving to the lead!

422
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:12,178
j-hope!

423
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:14,248
- Did he turn the game?
- What!

424
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,388

- What?
-Am I the no.1?

425
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:17,777

We won!

427
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:20,513

We can win if we finish 2nd and 3rd.

What are you doing?

429

(Feat. No.1 player is my friend)]
I thought you would win.

431
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,229
[Speechless]
Jimin and RM haven't finished the race.

432
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,415
Look at Jimin's monitor.

433
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,168
[My back is hurting...]
I played like this.

Everyone.

436
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:37,576
[Jimin has a lot to say]
[Asking for a rematch]
We need to play this round again.

437
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,133
I played like this.

438
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:42,253
[Jimin played with a flipped screen]
I'm not even kidding.

439
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:45,013
- Jimin, you should've done this.
- I played like this!

440
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,537
[I played like this!]
In this posture.

441
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:48,045
[Recognizing his passion]
He deserves a rematch.

442
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:48,866
[I'm sure I can win this time]

443
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:51,408
[They decided to play the
2nd round of speed match again]
The 2nd round, a speed match.

444
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:52,883
[Excited]
Everyone, ready?

445
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:56,533
[j-hope started a bit late]
He failed.

446
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,603
[Smooth cornering]
j-hope failed.

447

Hang on. I'm going backward now.

[P-please don't go backward]
You can't go backward.

451
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:06,870


452
00:17:06,782 --> 00:17:08,658
I'm sorry but you two
need to carry the team.

[Jung Kook stopped V]
- Don't do that.
- I blocked V's way!

[j-hope and V rapidly chase after]

456
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:18,778
[Wait for me!]
No!

457
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:20,543

I think Hobi played this before.

458
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:23,143
[j-hope and Jung Kook are fighting to win]
- j-hope...
- He's a dark horse.

459
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:28,483
[Why me?]
He keeps blocking me!

460
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:30,043
[The world of competition is cold-blooded]
I don't know who it is.

461
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:31,543
[Commentary 1]
But Jung Kook is furious.

462
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:33,318
[Commentary 2]
Better apologize to Jung Kook back home.

463
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,320
Right, say sorry at the dorm.

464
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,603
[j-hope is defending well]
He's great at defense.

465
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,463
[Hobi is winning!]
You need to repent today.

466
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:42,498
I think j-hope got the hang of this map.

467
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:44,603
[Team Red is making a fuss]
- Oh no!
- We lost.

468
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,003
[No way]
We lost.

469
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,953
[Embarrassed]
- What's happening?
- No.1 and 2 are from Team Blue.

470
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:50,494
No. 3, 4, 5 are us.

471
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:52,696
[Cold-headed commentary] [Team Red is...]
They were full of confidence and nothing else.

472
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,822
[Admitting]
True, but confidence is the best.

473
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:56,667
Jimin, are you really in 5th place?

474
00:17:56,947 --> 00:17:59,751
[Jung Kook is not doing well, either]
Hang on. I messed up.

475
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:02,327
[Cool-headed commentary]
Even if the monitor mishap didn't happen,

476
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:03,722
Jimin would have finished 5th.

477
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:05,612
[All I can do is laugh...]

478
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:08,031
[Disappointed]
Hobi blocked me!

479
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:10,886
[No.1! j-hope, do whatever you want]
You're an amazing player.

480
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:12,686
[Giving up]
Let's buy snacks.

481
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:15,965
- Let's play the last round for fun.
- Then, let's make it a bet.

482
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,936
[I want it]
Let's play the last round with carts.

483
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:19,766
Let's play an item match.

484
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,235
Speed or item? Please decide.

485
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,841
- Let's play an item match.
- It's up to you.

486
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:25,189
[Jimin wants to change his cart] [Busy changing his]
- Can I change my cart?
- Let's change it.

487
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:27,120
What's that fish?

488
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:30,012
[Jimin's new car: Fish car]
- Item, team match.
- What's this fish?

489
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:31,847
We've got a general.
You can see a general.

490
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:33,827
[Jung Kook plays a general]

491
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:36,527
[BTS are showing off their fancy carts]
- The items are so fancy.
- I haven't joined yet.

492
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:37,918
[Displeased]
Do you really want to do this?

493
00:18:37,943 --> 00:18:39,902
[Then, I will...]
- Do you want to do this?
- I'll equip all items.

494
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:42,197
[BTS is carefully choosing carts]
- I changed my cart.
- Me, too.

495
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:43,782
[What's that?]
That character is in the air.

496
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:44,827
[RM's car is in the air]

497
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:47,037
- What's that?
- It's a broom. Awesome, huh?

498
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:50,361
[Surprised]
Is that a Rolls-Royce?

499
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,202
[V's car is huge]
A jeep car came up.

500
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:54,373
[Loves it]
[Games are all about items]

501
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:57,915
[The last game!]
Hang on. We need to make a bet.

502
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,699
[Serious]
What should we bet on?

503
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:02,889
If we lose, we will give a massage
to the winning team members.

504
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:04,455
[Not interested]
I'm not interested.

505
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,901
[Taken aback]
What's up with you?

506
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,724
[Kidding]
I'm a game commentator.

507
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,918
[Jimin's suggestion]
Since we're going straight home...

508
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:15,033
[What about a shower?] [Shakes his head]
No, we'd have to change our clothes.

509
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:18,248
[Interested]
- Let's do something fun...
- Shower? - What about that?

510
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:19,634
[Persuading]
We'll go straight home, anyways.

511
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,978
[Falling for Jimin's suggestion]
- Let's do that.
- 1 out of 3!

512
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:24,240
- OK, a water bottle shower.
- Go!

513
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:26,918
[Sounds fun]
Then, play individually.

514
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:29,604
[Sounds better]
- Individual match?
- The last one in will get the penalty.

515
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,948
- Let's do this!
- The loser of the individual match!

516
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:35,661
[Extra round: Kartrider - item match]
[The members will compete individually]

517
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:38,826
[The one who comes in last will
dance to "Blood, Sweat & Tears"
while getting drenched in water]

518
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,558
[The members are ready]
- Ready?
- Ready!

519
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:41,573
Let's go!

520
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:43,978
[So nervous]
[A lot of tension]

521
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,222
[Sweeping his hair up]

522
00:19:45,222 --> 00:19:47,168
[Excited] [Excited to see the penalty]
Someone will get drenched!

523
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:49,043
[Anyone but me]
You just don't have to be last.

524
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,439
[Jin is sad he doesn't have a pet]
Hang on. I don't have a pet.

525
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:54,955
[Ignoring]
Let's start!

526
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:57,396
Here we go, everyone!

527
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,087
[Commentary]
They're running in
the 13th anniversary items.

528
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,720
[Jung Kook jumped into the water]
What? Death from a fall?

529
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,835
[Jin drowned after Jung Kook]
This is your fault, Jung Kook!

530
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,970
[Pied Piper Jung Kook, follow me]
Sorry, my bad.

531
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,316
[Hehe]
- j-hope is the last one.
- What's this?

532
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,989
[Surprised]
- What?
- What's this?

533

[Making a fuss] [Surprised]
- What's this?
- I'm the 6th.

534
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,448
No way!

535

[What's happening?]
- Oh, I messed up
- What's this?

536
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:21,857
- I'm in trouble.
- What?

537
00:20:21,857 --> 00:20:25,350
[SUGA laughs and the members are perplexed]
- What!
- Oh no!

538
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,021
What's this?

539
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:28,016
[What's going on?]

540
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:31,524
[They’re struggling with a cleaning robot]
- Oh no.
- What's this?

541
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,517
- What's this?
- What?

542
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:36,782
[This map is the best!]
We should've chosen this map.

543
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:40,762
[Surprised]
- Hey!
- It's blocking us.

544
00:20:40,787 --> 00:20:42,544
[Nervous RM]
- Hang on.
- What's this burger?

545
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:44,597
[The individual match is fiercer]
The individual match is funnier
than the team match.

546
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,222
Please, I don't want to be the last one!

547
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:49,202
[Apologizing to himself]
Sorry, I'm in 6th place.

548
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,239
[It's an individual match]
You only have yourself to be sorry to.

549
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:54,049
[RM apologizing to himself in the future]
Sorry to myself. I'm the 6th.

no.1 and no.2]

551

into the water] [No!]
Jung Kook!

552
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,390
[So relaxed]
- He tricked me into this.
- Jeon Jung Kook!

553

j-hope and RM...

554
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:06,751
[Please, I don't want to get showered]
No way. I will not be the last one.

555
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:08,580
[j-hope the ace is currently in last place]
- j-hope is coming in the 6th.
- Here I go.

556
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,879
[RM plays Kartrider with his voice]
- Here I go!

It got you.

561
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:27,568
[Jimin is left behind because of the robot]
- No! - Help!

562

00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:41,128
[Shouting]
What's this ghost?

567
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:42,908

I am so thankful to be the 4th.

569

[j-hope came in second]
[What a mess]

are excluded from the penalty]

Jimin, who failed to finish the race]
Nooooo!

[Failed to finish the race]

576
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:03,169
[Festive mood]
I told you it would be you.

577
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:06,194
[Is it true? Am I the last one?]
At the end...

578
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:07,768
[Shouting]
What was that ghost?!

579
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,706
[I'm not a ghost... I'm the cleaning robot]

580
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:11,937
What was the ghost at the end?

581
00:22:12,536 --> 00:22:14,833
[Jimin was no.1]
- What was that ghost?
- Jimin, you were no.1.

582
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:16,613
I tried to go this way but

583
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:19,516
[Reenacting the scene]
- it pressed me into the corner.
- All right.

584
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,099
[The one who proposed the penalty]
So, Jimin will get doused with water.

585
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:25,422
[His sad back]

586
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,933
[Jin, Jimin, Jung Kook choose
a penalty for the team match]
Please pick one.

- The losing team...
- Is this for the team match?

588
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:34,827

for the team match.
- Let's pick any.

589
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,563
[What's Jimin's penalty?]
Jimin, please open it.

590
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,296
[Throwing it to the floor]
Pick up after the winners eat...

591
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:45,903
- Jimin has to clean up after getting drenched.
- Oh, poor thing.

592
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:47,913
[Teasing Jimin 1]
I will drop food everywhere.

That's mean. It looks so good.

595
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:56,373
[Approaching like being bewitched]
It looks so delicious!

596
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:57,718
[Penalty]
What music do you want?

597
00:22:57,718 --> 00:22:59,520
[Right after the producer says]
"Blood, Sweat & Tears". A sexy one.

598
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,874
[Innocent]
Jimin, show us something sexy.

599
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:05,786
[Commentary]
How did you enjoy today's game?
Since we won

600
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,042
we'll enjoy this snack and
talk about how we felt.

601
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:10,988
Right, Jin's team always loses.

602
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:13,833
[Sad]
- Right.
- Jin's team always loses.

603
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:17,673
- That's our Kim Seokjin.
- I laugh so much on "RUN BTS."

604
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:19,338
[Satisfied]
- It's so much fun.
- There were a lot of funny situations.

605
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:22,906
- If you're on Jin's team, you will lose.
- Actually, it's been a while since

606
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:26,288
[Nom nom]
we played a game all together.
Although SUGA was the MC.

607
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:27,572
I think that's why it was fun.

608
00:23:27,597 --> 00:23:29,473
[Jimin's inevitable penalty time]
Jimin, please say goodbye

609
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:31,890
and wrap this up with your penalty.

610
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:34,336
I really enjoyed today's game.

611
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:36,853

- Don't get carried away.

612
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:38,783
[Today's lessons learned: Stay still]
Everyone, stay still.

613
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:41,282
[Teasing him]
If you had stayed quiet,
this penalty wouldn't exist.

614
00:23:41,282 --> 00:23:43,272
[Do not open your mouth, by Jimin]
Let's not say anything.

615
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:44,672
That's the lesson I learned today.

616
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:47,132
[Please show the penalty]
Then, the last penalty.

617
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:49,177
[Jimin is posing]
- Music, cue.
- They won't even give me a bite.

618
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,796
[Oh?]
- Will you play music?
- Will you?

619
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,405
- What?
- Let's start again

620

[1, 2, 1, 2]

627
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:19,185

You need to dance.

[Jimin looks good even when he's drenched]
Be careful, it's slippery.

631
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:28,149
It looks cool.
Like a scene from a music video.

632
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:30,334
[I'm not cute anymore]
It's like a scene from a music video.

633
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,893

- Only Jimin can do this.
- Cool.

635
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:38,797

- I could have never pulled this off.
- Right.

Why did you eat this?

641
00:24:52,206 --> 00:24:54,614

- SUGA told me I could.

642
00:24:54,614 --> 00:24:57,290
[Jim-derella]
I'm not on this team.

643
00:24:58,537 --> 00:25:01,212
[The winners leave first]
Please clean this place up.
You can eat the leftovers.

644
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:02,917

I'm good at cleaning.

Delicious.
